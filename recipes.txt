Preheat the oven to 350°.
Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.
Lightly scramble the eggs in a medium bowl using a whisk. Add in the remaining liquid ingredients and stir together until blended.
Place all of the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and stir together with a whisk. Add in half of the wet ingredients, and mix. Then repeat with remaining wet ingredients.
Divide the batter evenly into the cake pans. Drop the pans on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles.
Bake at 350° for 30 minutes or until the toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Allow the cakes to cool for 30 minutes before frosting.
Sift the powdered sugar and set aside. In your mixing bowl beat together the cream cheese and butter until fluffy. Add in the vanilla and then in batches add the powdered sugar. Beat until fluffy and ready to spread.
